# Iris-Image-Processing
Code with GUI for Database Creation, encoding and verification 
This work is an agglomeration of works from :
1.  Prakash Manandhar (pmanandhar@umassd.edu)
2.  Peter Kovesi & Libor Masek,Department of Computer Science & Software Engineering, The University of Western Australia
 
 Few snippets are left for testing. This work encompases works from various others and packages it with a GUI.
 
 A standard database of images is used- CASIA. 
 
 Proto1 is the main GUI code. This calls all the other functions.
