First, a database has to be created. I am still working on having names instead of numbers.
For now, each successive user gets a new number.

First run database.m and input images from the CASIA database for each user. I have chosen the left eye and in some rare cases,
went for the right one. This code will create a corresponding matlab database with segmented, normalized image along with the noise mask.

Then run proto1.m. This segments, normalizes, encodes and compares the imput images with all the ones in the database.
